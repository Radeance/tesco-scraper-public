## üîó Legality of web scraping and scraping of grocery store products

The **Tesco UK Scraper** is designed to ethically extract **only publicly available product data and manufacturer information**, and it **does not** scrape private user data such as personal email addresses or personal identifiers.

We therefore believe that our scrapers, when used for ethical purposes by Apify users, are safe. However, you should be aware that your results could contain personal data. Personal data is protected by the GDPR in the European Union and by other regulations around the world. You should not scrape personal data unless you have a legitimate reason to do so. If you're unsure whether your reason is legitimate, consult your lawyers. You can also read our [blog post](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/) on the legality of web scraping
